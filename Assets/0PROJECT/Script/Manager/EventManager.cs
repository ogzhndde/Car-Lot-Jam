/// The class in which all the events used in the game are controlled.
/// All events in the game are defined under the GameEvent enum. Then, in the class where you want these events to be used, definition is made via enum.
/// There are 3 main methods: AddHandler, RemoveHandler and Broadcast.
/// AddHandler: The method in which the event is assigned and added to the dictionary.
/// RemoveHandler: A method that removes the defined event from the dictionary if the object becomes inactive.
/// Broadcast: The method you use where you want the event to run.
/// Different overloads of these are also defined in the manager. 
/// If you want to send an event with a variable, you can use those overloads.
